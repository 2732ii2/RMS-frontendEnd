- : Learning in this project : let say you want to send the file
# as event.target.files[0]
- firstly you can't send that directly you will see empty object in payload
: formData.append you have to use

: mutler you have use
 
then controller is going to be 
app.post("/whatever",upload.any(),(req,res)=>
{
    /// then you have do this \
    console.log(req.body)    for the text or list attributes
    console.log(req.files)   for the file that you are sending 
})
